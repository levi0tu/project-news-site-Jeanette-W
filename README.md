# News Site

The assignment was to create a news-website using html, css grid and flexbox.

## The problem

I started this course and project year ago and only now have the time to complete. So I had to start refreshing what I previously learned.
I continued with the draft I had. I used AI to help me with the logo and texts. I also used chatGPT and Perplexity to help me sort out what was wrong with my code and suggest solutions to what I wanted to achieve. I spent many hours testing everything.
